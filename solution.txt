            Pseudocode
Initialize and empty string called result to store substrings
Outer loop iterates from index 0 to the end of the string
Inner loop iterates from one position after the start index to the end of string
Exract the substring using string.slice(i,j) and push it to the result array
After both loops complete, return the result array containing all consecutive substrings.


            solution
This solution generates all consecutive substrings of a given input string.
It uses two nested loops: the outer loop which selects the starting index of the substring,
 and the inner loop which selects the ending index, expanding the substring from the starting position.
Each substring is extracted using the slice method and stored in a result array,
 which is returned at the end.
